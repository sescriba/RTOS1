/*
 * This file contains some supporting functions that are used by all the
 * examples.  These fall into three categories:
 *
 * 1) IO functions:  vPrintString() and vPrintStringAndNumber().
 *
 * To allow maximum portability the book examples do not rely on any chip
 * specific IO, and instead just output to a console.  However, printing to a
 * console in this manner is not thread safe, so a function is used so the
 * terminal output can be wrapped in a critical section.
 *
 * 2) RTOS hook functions: vApplicationMallocFailedHook(), vApplicationIdleHook()
 * vApplicationIdleHook(), vApplicationStackOverflowHook() and
 * vApplicationTickHook().
 *
 * These are functions that can optionally be defined by the application writer
 * in order to get notifications of events occurring with the executing
 * application.  More information is provided in the comments within the
 * function definitions in this file, and in the book text.
 *
 * 3) configASSERT() implementation: vAssertCalled()
 *
 * The FreeRTOS source code uses an assert() function to trap user and other
 * errors.  configASSERT() is defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h to call
 * vAssertCalled(), which is implemented in this file.  More information is
 * provided in the book text.
